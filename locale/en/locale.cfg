yield=Yield in kT TNT equivalent
height=Burst height in meters
stride=Damage range increment 

[mod-setting-description]
yield=Smaller yields are much nicer for performance. You may find performance degrades significantly above 1 kT or so.
height=Damage is highly non-linear with respect to burst height. For a 1 kT nuke, a burst height of around 250m maximizes the 400 damage radius. This scales with the cube root of the yield, so for a 1 T blast the 400 damage radius is maximized around 25m.
stride=Increment that damage radii are calculated for. Setting below 25m or so may result in a significant performance decrease.
